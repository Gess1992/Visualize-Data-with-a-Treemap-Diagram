#Information

You will find information about generating axes at https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#axes-d3-axis. Required (non-virtual) DOM elements are queried on the moment of each test. If you use a frontend framework (like Vue for example), the test results may be inaccurate for dynamic content. We hope to accommodate them eventually, but these frameworks are not currently supported for D3 projects.
